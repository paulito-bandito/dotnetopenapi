# Swagger/OpenApi DotNetCore Example

Just a simple example to  illustrate how OpenApi / Swagger might be useful for dotnet programs. 

## Running code
- Use "Visual Studio" IDE. Press "Play"
- It will open to the Swagger Editor where you can inspect the API.

## Viewing Swagger / Open API Documents:
- Swagger Editor: `http://localhost:{YOUR PORT}/swagger/index.html`
- Swagger JSON: `http://localhost:{YOUR PORT}}/swagger/1.0.0/swagger.json`

## Why we might want to adopt this technology
- It allows us to have a "contract" that we can then auto-gen controllers, front-ends, or even tests with.
- Speeds development by not needing to update a Postman file.
- Improves communication with Backend and Frontend developers.
- Much More.
