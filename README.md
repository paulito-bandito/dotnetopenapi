# Swagger/OpenApi Petstore Auto Gen Tests for C#

Just a simple example to shamelessly try to influence my wonderful colleagues (see what I'm doing there? hahahah. ) in an effort to adopt this very useful technology. 

This Techonology will allow us to 
  1) Understand any given API at a glance (it will have an updated list of all API methods, exceptions, and default values).
  2) Allow us to Mock a service we don't have access to.
  3) Auto-generate tests based on our Swagger/OpenAPI contract.
  4) Speed development time (you can create a stubbed service for which ever piece you aren't working on, or script specific sequences of requests instead of manually executing them via Postman).
